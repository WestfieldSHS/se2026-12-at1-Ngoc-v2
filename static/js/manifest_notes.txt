This manifest.json acts as sort of like a notes for my pwa project for when someone wants to install my website. 
Before the browser actually look at my codes it will look at my manifestjson files to check if the website is installable, 
the browser then display this info to the user. WIthout the jsonfile, the browser do not know what the app is called and the install button wont 
appear for the user to install 

name = shown on big screen
shortname = shown on small screen like phone
start_url = which page open when the app is installed
display (standalone) = when the app is install, the user will not see the back and foraward arrown and the search bar and stuff of the browser, just the app alone. 
backgroundcolor: the colour that is hsown whne the app is loading. 
themecolour:the top bar colour
icons: the big icon is for desktop and such and the small icon is for phone
